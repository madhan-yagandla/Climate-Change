    <h2>The Science of Climate Change</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Climate change is driven by the greenhouse effect, caused by the buildup of CO₂ and other gases trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
      <h3>Key Elements of Climate Change Science</h3>
      <img src="https://letstalkgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GREENHOUSE-EFFECT-1.jpg" alt="Greenhouse Effect" width="40%" height="40%" style="border-radius: 5px;">
        <h4><p style="color: brown;">The Greenhouse Effect:</p></h4>
        <ul type="square">
        <p><li>The greenhouse effect is a natural process in which greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and water vapor trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, keeping the planet warm enough to support life. However, since the Industrial Revolution, human activities, such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation, have increased the concentration of these gases, leading to additional warming.</li></p>
        
       <h4> <p style="color: brown;">Temperature Rise:</p></h4>
       <p><li>The global average temperature has risen by about 1.1°C since the late 19th century. This change, although seemingly small, has a significant impact on ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels. Scientists use data from historical climate records, tree rings, ice cores, and ocean sediments to compare current warming trends with past fluctuations, revealing that the current warming rate is unprecedented.</li></p>
        
        <h4><p style="color: brown;">Carbon Emissions:</p> </h4>
        <p><li>Human activities release large amounts of CO₂ and other GHGs into the atmosphere, trapping heat that would otherwise escape into space. The main sources are burning fossil fuels for energy, industrial processes, and deforestation. Since CO₂ can remain in the atmosphere for centuries, even current emissions have long-term impacts on climate.</li></p>
        
        
        
        <h4><p style="color: brown;">Albedo Effect:</p> </h4> 
        <p><li>Melting ice reduces the Earth’s reflectivity (albedo), causing more heat to be absorbed, further warming the planet.</li></p>
        <h4><p style="color: brown;">Permafrost Thaw: </p> </h4>
        <p><li>As permafrost melts, it releases stored methane, a potent greenhouse gas, intensifying the warming.
        Ocean Dynamics: Oceans play a crucial role in climate regulation by absorbing CO₂ and excess heat. However, as they warm, they expand, contributing to sea level rise. Warmer waters also disrupt marine ecosystems, impact coral reefs, and affect fish populations. Ocean acidification, another outcome of CO₂ absorption, harms marine life by altering water chemistry.</li></p>
        
        
        
        <h4><p style="color: brown;">Climate Models and predictions: </p> </h4>
        <p><li>Climate models use mathematical equations to simulate interactions within the climate system. These models, which incorporate data on atmospheric composition, ocean circulation, and land use, help predict future climate scenarios based on different levels of greenhouse gas emissions.</li></p></ul>
